## General
The CVE List was launched by **MITRE** as a community effort in 1999, and the U.S. National Vulnerability Database (NVD) was launched by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** in 2005.

### CVE
CVE - A list of entries—each containing an identification number, a description, and at least one public reference—for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. CVE Entries are used in numerous cybersecurity products and services from around the world, including NVD.

### NVD
NVD - A vulnerability database built upon and fully synchronized with the CVE List so that any updates to CVE appear immediately in NVD.

### CVE and NVD Relationship 
The CVE List feeds NVD, which then builds upon the information included in CVE Entries to provide enhanced information for each entry such as fix information, severity scores, and impact ratings. As part of its enhanced information, NVD also provides advanced searching features such as by OS; by vendor name, product name, and/or version number; and by vulnerability type, severity, related exploit range, and impact.

#### While separate, both CVE and NVD are sponsored by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and both are available to the public and free to use.

One of the major vulnerability data sources is the National Vulnerability Database. Commonly known as NVD, it is a U.S. government database created and maintained by NIST. The NVD is a superset of a list of publicly known security vulnerabilities, maintained by MITRE. CVE is accepted by the security community, internationally, as the defacto database for vulnerabilities. Users and developers of both closed and open software attempt to issue CVE IDs for all security issues found.

The NVD is synchronized with the CVE and adds an entry for every CVE vulnerability assigned including analysis of the vulnerability, additional info and severity scoring. It is not uncommon for the NVD to be automatically fed to threat intelligence and vulnerability management software. Thus, errors in the either the CVE or NVD could put users at risk of being exposed to publicly known vulnerabilities. The implications of such errors could be from mild to critical depending on the severity of the vulnerability, as there are always malicious actors that actively try to exploit known CVEs.
